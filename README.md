# DataSketches is now Apache DataSketches. 

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.

In 2019, after 8 years of development and 5 years as in Open Source, we began the important migration from a stand-alone GitHub site to being a member of the Apache Software Foundation community.  As of December, 2020, we became an official Top-Level Project within the ASF.
